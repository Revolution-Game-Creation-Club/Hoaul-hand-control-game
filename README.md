> A basic hand-gesture controlled game.

The motivation behind the game was from this GIF that I found on Reddit one day -

I developed this project to use my knowledge related to PyGame and OpenCV in combination. This project is an extension to the [Vixon](https://github.com/prnvdixit/Vixon) application.


## Usage

For finding out how to set HSV ranges for objects - Refer [Vixon's README](https://github.com/prnvdixit/Vixon/blob/master/README.md).

Once you have set the ranges - you can start playing the game using the objects (/colours) you set earlier for left and right control.

For left hand control - Use ```W and S```

For right hand control - Use ```Arrow_Up and Arrow_Down```

### Aim

Just reach to the top of the poles without colliding with the stones. You would get aided by some special stones - Reducing the size of ball, Converting the ball to rock, Freezing the stone movement. Each subsequent level involves increased difficulty - More stones, faster movement and stickier controls.
