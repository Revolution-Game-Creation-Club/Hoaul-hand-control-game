## Hoaul

A basic hand-gesture controlled game.

The motivation behind the game was from this GIF that I found on Reddit one day - 


### Aim

Just reach to the top of the poles without colliding with the stones. You would get aided by some special stones - Reducing the size of ball, Converting the ball to rock, Freezing the stone movement. Each subsequent level involves increased difficulty - More stones, faster movement and stickier controls.
